Centralizing materials for proposing data model for Nightscout.  There
is a demand to quickly serialize and deserialize data in Nightscout
between a bunch of different textual and machine representations.

This is an experiment to see which tools can effectively help document
the data model, using typescript, typson, swagger, json-schema and
related technologies.
